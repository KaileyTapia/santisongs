<body>
    <p>I barely like people</p>
    <p>and you are barely an exception</p>
    <p>I hate being under pressure</p>
    <p>makes me nervous, I can hardly hit send</p>
    <p>You put me under all sorts of pressure</p>
    <p>but with you somehow it makes me feel like a diamond</p>
    <p>You make me act out when I don't want to!</p>
    <p>You make me so mad!</p>
    <p>And I can hardly breath when I'm around you</p>
    <p>from the way you're holding my hand!</p>
    <p>And you might need a wooden spoon for your shoulder</p>
    <p>from the way I'm bubbling over!</p>
    <p>And you make me feel like I'm on air</p>
    <p>I could never go back down there</p>
    <p>back there</p>
    <p>Go back down there?</p>
    <p>I could never</p>
    <p>and I love how we are together!</p>
