    <title>Just Feel Calm</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>I love the way that your fingers</p>
    <p>dance across the fret board</p>
    <p>when you play</p>
    <p>and your voice kisses</p>
    <p>my closing eyelids</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My whole body aches</p>
    <p>when I smell your scent</p>
    <p>when you're around me</p>
    <p>It smells like blue and sand</p>
    <p>the ocean and the sun...</p>
    <p>and I just feel calm</p>
    <p>around you</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Cuz I</p>
    <p>don't get butterflies</p>
    <p>the ones they're talking about</p>
    <p>like I'm missing out</p>
    <p>And I</p>
    <p>don't get nervous</p>
    <p>when our eyes meet</p>
    <p>it doesn't make me feel weak</p>
    <p>I just feel calm</p>
    <p>around you</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Do not give me heart racing!</p>
    <p>Give me slow and steady, growing, day by day</p>
    <p>There's nothing rushed about this love</p>
    <p>There's nothing fast about the games we play</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My head is under water</p>
    <p>I hear nothing but muffles</p>
    <p>and all my love is coming OUT IN BUBBLES</p>
    <p>I'm suffocating...</p>
    <p>It feels warm and nice</p>
    <p>They'll never surface...</p>
    <p>all my feelings always waiting</p>
    <p>at the bottom, at the bottom of the pool</p>
    <p>I can't say what I want</p>
    <p>I'm way too scared but still</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I just feel calm</p>
    <p>I just feel calm</p>
    <p>I just feel</p>
    <p>calm</p>
