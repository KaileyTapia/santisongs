    <p>How many songs can I write about you?</p>
    <p>How many til my heart makes it through...</p>
    <p>through my words, through my lyrics, through my strums</p>
    <p>I could write you a song, but then I'd have to write another one</p>
    <p>Cuz our love's always growing and changing</p>
    <p>Its like I can't keep up</p>
    <p>It feels like every word still wouldn't be enough</p>
    <p>What can I express when we're an oil painted mesh</p>
    <p>But I love every color that we add or take away</p>
    <p>I love every color, every textured streak we make</p>
    <p>Yeah I love every color, despite change or what stays the same</p>
    <p>Yeah I love every color and I love what we paint</p>
    <p>I get insecure and even jealous sometimes</p>
    <p>Say it's not in my blood...but that might be a lie</p>
    <p>A lie that I say so I can hide away</p>
    <p>I could close myself off, but its already way too late...</p>
    <p>Cuz you are a rainbow</p>
    <p>and I'm grasping a the dew</p>
    <p>and I never imagined I could get this close to someone</p>
    <p>that I could get this close to you...</p>
    <p>You're green to my eyes</p>
    <p>Your voice is yellow sunshine to my ears</p>
    <p>Your red rolling dance moves</p>
    <p>and those orange shoes</p>
    <p>Did you know you sing in blue hues?</p>
    <p>Your lavender touch, flakes off and melts into my skin</p>
    <p>disipates too soon</p>
    <p>Your deep violet words that encourage my tongue to become</p>
    <p>like sweet honey too...</p>
    <p>Well not that often but anywho!</p>
    <p>Thank God for the colors!</p>
    <p>I thank God for you...</p>
    <p>Thank God for the expression of notes,</p>
    <p>my words alone... could never do...</p>
    <p>Thank God for the colors!</p>
    <p>I thank God for you...</p>
    <p>Thank God for the expression of notes,</p>
    <p>my words alone... could never do...</p>
