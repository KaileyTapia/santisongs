<body>
    <p>I used to be the queen of "cat and mouse"</p>
    <p>I used to be the best at hiding my feelings, if nothing else</p>
    <p>I never text first</p>
    <p>Oh my gosh! I was the worst!</p>
    <p>But with you that don't work</p>
    <p>Cuz I can't wait a minute</p>
    <p>So I text you first</p>
    <p>and ask you if you wanna call, I know I sound so desperate</p>
    <p>That's cause I am</p>
    <p>I become a poet when time demands</p>
    <p>I'm a poet</p>
    <p>I'm so stoic...</p>
    <p>I become a poet when it comes to loving you</p>
    <p>I'm a poet</p>
    <p>No, not so stoic</p>
    <p>I become a poet when it comes to loving you</p>
    <p>Loving you</p>
    <p>I love you</p>
    <p>Loving you</p>
    <p>I love you</p>
