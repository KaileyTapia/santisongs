    <p>Hitting on me through text infront of your parents</p>
    <p>Oh what an idiot</p>
    <p>I wanted to tell you that I liked it but I didn't get the chance</p>
    <p>I feel like I'm somehow behind you</p>
    <p>Just wanted to remind you that</p>
    <p>I'm not that far off from growing up</p>
    <p>Just need a little more time</p>
    <p>I'm not that far off from growing up</p>
    <p>Just need a little more time</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I don't know why</p>
    <p>all my feelings make  perfect sense</p>
    <p>when I'm a senseless mess,</p>
    <p>missing you</p>
    <p>It's not like I'd regret</p>
    <p>what I wanted to do</p>
    <p>And I hate this curse</p>
    <p>how my thoughts are so crystal clear when your near</p>
    <p>All telling me not to mess up</p>
    <p>but I've already said too much...</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm getting worse at hiding all my feelings</p>
    <p>and my disapointments when</p>
    <p>we say hi too late and goodbye too soon</p>
    <p>and I feel like sometimes we're being pulled apart</p>
    <p>and it is exhausting...</p>
    <p>but I'm way too young to grow bitter and old</p>
    <p></p>
